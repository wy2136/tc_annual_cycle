v3 (2020-11-25): AM2.5C360 seeds use vorticity threshold of 8e-4 instead of 4e-4
v4 (2020-12-08): data in scatter plots are normalized by annual total
v4p1 (2020-12-08): scatter plots from obs and models merged

*_olife24hr*: track has over 24 hours over ocean grids

*_5N*: genesis probability averaged over 5-30N(S) instead of the default 10-30N(S)

wyfig??_* are new versions that replace wyFig??.*
